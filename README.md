Coaches E-Commerce Site

Business to Customer
Single Payment system (not subscription)
Product is affordable video tutorials designed to encourage sign up to online or in-person coaching sessions. 
Some customers will be satisfied with videos, this acts as passive income for the coach and filters favourable clients who are familiar and already like coach’s style.
Video tutorials are 25 minutes each(could even be 15 mins if that’s preferred). They come in sets. Access to video sets can be purchased individually or bundles. 
Suggest £10 a set or £25 for 3. This is cheap(need to balance self-valuation with accessibility - NEEDS DISCUSSION WITH COACH - openly addressing this low cost might be most confident thing of all- cheap videos because session are where the real work happens
Discount codes need to work so they can be distributed on social media
A newsletter with subscription option needs to open once with a pop-up including offer of discount. Newsletter released with each new set of videos. No regular spam bullshit. 
Online “E-Session” slots. Clients can book these appointments and pre-pay. Coach must keep these appointment and block out unavailability ahead of time. Could offer first session free after sign-up for discovery and assessment. This could be achieved with a calendar booking system.
On-demand E-session slots are a chance to engage in a new client. A method of connecting with a tentative potential client which is the challenge as people lacking confidence struggle to reach out. COACH DICTATE PRICE PLEASE
Contact form for In-person sessions. Need to discuss preferences of the coach
Selling tickets to group session is also a great way to offer an affordable entry for tentative clients. Now it’s likely early on that anyone booking may find themselves in a one-to-one. This can be made clear that it’s a potential on quieter weeks and a bonus for them if they are so lucky to get a private session at a discounted group rate. COACH DICTATE PRICES PLEASE
About Section needs to address the history of the coach and blend every story with how that relates to the type of coaching being offered.
Testimonials (can be fake or real depending on availability) can create a form for these to be recorded electronically after sessions if necessary. Maybe ask professionals coach has worked with previously for one liner quotes. Too awkward then ask family or I will make them up. 
Resources section : this is where the coach can show their knowledge and keenness to impart confidence and wisdom on the client. Can be a list of book, sites, videos. Must not redirect to other coaches unless agreed with other coach previously and not funneling business away. Good to inform, no point shooting self in the foot. 
Tech Specs : 
Need to be able to login with email, username or social accounts links, namely Facebook and Google 
Need to be able to pay with card, Apple Pay or PayPal
Bookings should be able to push an appointment to Google calendar of client or outlook calendar.
A video conferencing tool might be useful. Equally an emailed video link for Google chat or zoom might be better quality and just as good. Offer FaceTime as an alternative option for IPhone users. 
Needs its own domain
Not expecting drastic traffic. Heroku hosting should be fine.
Accessibility :
site will be fully accessible with hidden features for users with disabilities, image tags and text on all features for clients with screen readers. 
Pathing :
users can browse all content and videos without playing them while not logged in. Only logged in accounts can access the videos they have paid for.
Account page of users shows previous purchases and session bookings 
Booked Sessions :
Authorised accounts could pay for sessions in singles or bundles. This contains all the coaches payments to a single platform. Organised their schedule and leaves room for moving or rebooking sessions.
This keeps cash out of the equation which feels more professional and keeps the coaches image clean. Also avoids issues with clients forgetting to pay or not bringing cash on the day.
If the coach needs to rebook there needs to be a process for this. The client account is refunded a session, an email is sent, and they are able to rebook a free slot in the calendar. 
Vibe :
Confidence / Clarity / impact 
Practicing what you preach is important. Messages and processes need to be extra clear and effective.
There is a tendency towards some pushy salesmanship from some coaches site. Particularly Americans that I’ve looked over. This could be a culture thing. Driving with negative fear building statements (“you don’t know what you’re missing”, “can you afford not to take this course”). But I really don’t like this and think there is a gentle pragmatic approach that allows the client to come to you willingly or walk off if they feel it’s not right. 
This positive gentle approach also fosters a more positive community, client retention and recommendations by word of mouth. 
Aesthetically there needs to be a clear brand image. A logo and continuation in the typography. 
Classy, legible, soothing tones. I like off-white skin tones with a single brand colour. 
A three word mantra for a tag line. This defines your brand. They are the words the client says to their friend across the water cooler.
Trustworthy, quality service, approachable by all
Business Services :
It’s good to advertise B2B services but we will keep this to a contact form with a brief About Section describing the business courses. No business will buy online and it distracts/intimidates private clients. 
Gifting : 
Session or session bundles as well as video access can be purchased as a gift. This does not authorise the buyer account but generates a code and email. This is sent to the recipient email. The recipient can create an account and cash in the gift of videos or sessions which will be debited to their account
CONTENT TYPES :
Content always needs to include a practical tip for the client. What can they do to improve. 


Videos:
example of problem behaviour / description of why people do this / practical solutions 
Theory vids : mindset and ways to encourage this 
Video set examples : 
Confidence Vocal Techniques
Clarity in Body Language
Managing Confrontation 
Business Communication 
Confident Lifestyle Choices
Communicating in Close Relationships
Parenting - Communicating with Children
Women in Business - Dealing with Challenges
Successful Interview Technique
Managing People with Clarity
Impact Public Speaking
Feeling Comfortable in Social Settings
First Impressions with Gravity
Video quality needs to be high, sound quality needs to be immaculate, setting should be calming and focused on coach. No AI blur effects. Waist to head unless legs are needed for content. Looking at the lense. Should feel natural, like a one to one. 
These are tasters for clients to feel a little of what coach’s E-session feel like. They should feel satisfied with the content and keen absorbers should want to feel comfortable with wanting to ask more questions, this is what sessions are for. 
Complex videos should be book ended with an acknowledgment that this is an overview and that watchers who find the content helpful but feel they need more should reach out for a discovery chat, don’t push bookings or further payments. Need to speak and see if coach can help first. 
Rules: 
Clients can cancel up to 24 hours before a session.
Session token is refunded and they can book again. 
Within 24 hours session is consumed.
More than 15 minutes lateness will result in cancellation. No reason, no problem. Valid reason given via email then coach can refund token at own discretion. (Simple tool for this in site will be included. 
If client buys several session and then doesn’t want the remainder after a session it is fine to refund these. No point being stingey if it costed coach no more time. No refund on gifted sessions. 
Session must be used within 12 months or they will be cancelled. This encourages use.

Media Theory:
Rotate one inspirational tid bit – one video with advice for screen actors – one advert for coaching – one – one video for communication coaching – one tid bit poster – one advert – one 
Video with useful tip taken while walking
Board with quote from someone you admire and a break down of what that means to you
Board advert for coaching
Video snippet from an interview
Board advice for screen actors or coaching for communicating
Board advert for coaching
Rinse repeat
NEED TO INCLUDE MASSIVE LIST OF KEYWORDS HIDDEN BEHIND VIDEO FOR SEO

# James Dunne Coaching - A Communication Coaching Website
<img src="static/images/screen_01.png" ><br>
<hr>

## Overview
This project is designed and developed to help users create and manage their own recipe books for cooking at home. Think Pinterest for foodies. The users are given the option to create their own recipes, add recipes from other users to their own cookbook collections, furnish their own user profile, and leave comments on other recipes. All these functionalities are available to any user with an account. <br>
The website was created for domestic users, but there is no reason that businesses wouldn't also use it. This is a working demonstration of this site model which has the potential to be scaled to a functioning business in it's own right. <br>
**James Dunne Coaching - cookbook building website** was developed using Python (Django), HTML, CSS and JavaScript by storing the data in a PostgreSQL database.
<br><br>
The fully deployed project can be accessed at [this link](https://jdcoaching-49c095ee8d82.herokuapp.com/).<br><br>

**Project Objectives:**<br> 
* To create a website with a simple and intuitive User Experience;
* To add content which is relevant and informative;
* To differentiate between user accounts and an admin account for non-code literate business content management;
* To implement fully functional features that will ease logged-in user's experience with the site and help them to integrate it's use into their lifestyle;
* To make the website available and functional on every device.<br><br>

### Scope<hr>
**Simple and intuitive User Experience**<br>
* Ensure the navigation menu is visible and functional at any stage of using the site;
* Ensure every page has a relevant name which fits its content;
* Ensure the users will get visual feedback when navigating through pages;
* Ensure the users will get visual feedback when navigating through recipes collections;
* Create a design which does not confuse users and matches a singluar brand image.

**Relevant content**<br>
* Recipes have clear instrustions, ingredients and descriptions;
* Menu and cookbook navigations blocks are clear and well designed;
* Create a scrollable page which shows all the recipes in the database;
* Create a section beneath each recipe with customer reviews for full transparency.

**Features for upgraded experience**<br>
* Create a favouriting system for prioritizing specific recipes in a cookbook;
* Create a business profile option for professional chefs to sell their cookbooks on the platform;
* Create a search function which includes food genres to allow groupings and style searches;

* Admin accounts are able to block accounts for abusing the platform;
* Admin accounts can delete database entries which do not meet basic format compliances;
* Client accounts can create their own recipes, manage their own collections and create variant copies of other user recipes. They can also write reviews on any public recipes.

**Responsiveness**<br>
* Create a responsive design for desktop, tablet and mobile devices.<br><br>

### Structure<hr>
The structure of the website is divided into six pages; with content depending on account specifications <br>
-The **Home** page is visible for new and returning users, it includes an about section and buttons to register or login;<br>
-**Register/Login** is a pop-up overlay on top of the Home page;<br>
-**Logout** feature is a modal that helps user exit their current account;<br>
-The **Nav Menu** is the same across all pages however it is simplified before logging in;<br>
-The **Kitchen** page is only visible for the logged-in clients and displays the logged-in users collection of Cookbooks and Dishes along with a brief bio of the user;<br>
-The **Dish Wall** is the main display and acts as the home page for logged in users. It displays a scrollable gallery of Dish-Tiles from the database;<br>
-The **Create** page has two sub-pages, Create-Cookbook and Create-Dish;<br>
-The **Create-Cookbook** page allows users to name their book, rite a brief description and pic a cover;<br>
-The **Create-Dish** page allows users to create a recipe or Dish-Tile to add to the database;<br>

### Skeleton<hr>
**Wireframes**<br>
The wireframes for mobile and desktop were created with [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) tool and can be viewed [here](static/images/Wireframes.png)<br>

**Database**<br>
The project uses the PostgreSQL relational database for storing the data.<br>
Two diagrams were made to represent the relation between the tables

## Agile Methodology
This project was developed using the Agile methodology. User stories were central in planning steps taken. User stories were broken down into acceptance criteria and these were checked off using githubs project KanBan board functionality. These can all be seen publicly attached to this repo. Some acceptance criteria were beyond the scope of the educational project and timeline so have not been met. However they were retained to make it clear the greater goal for the project and to give context to what has already been built; compromises have been made where possible so that absolutely no core functionality for this first iteration and base version of the design have been left out.<br>

## Features
### Existing Features<hr>
#### Create, Read, Update, Delete
Creation of 

<img src="static/images/screen_03.png" >

#### Client Profiles
The users' accounts have been created using the **django allauth** module. This way, information about the current user can be accessed from the template and displayed for the user to access the site. The client profile model contains a bio, a profile picture. These are displayed on the user's profile. The profile can be edited easily and is accessed on the view_clientprofile page along with all the user's other content, such as their bookings, booking tokens, and video sets, for easy access and management.<br>

### Testing
## Manual Testing
Each user experience function was tested thoroughly by manually logging in as a non-admin user and attempting to take the steps to create content, read content, edit content and delete content. This is true for reviews, recipes and cookbooks as well as user profiles. 

The defensive programming has also been tested manually. By finding the url of a particular post, then logging out, and attempting to access this same url. The @login_required decorator on the views for post_details stops unauthorised users from accessing anything other than the index, which only shows a welcome and prompt for registering and the about and contact pages. The @login_required addition to settings allows us to set a specified redirect for any unauthorised attempt to any accepted url and view which uses this decorator. My setting simply returns the attempt to the index. 

<img src="static/images/screen_04.png" >

The admin functionalities, for creating, editing, deleting, authorizing and managing all models in the database has been thoroughly tested in the making of the site. 

All the forms used in the site have been thoroughly tested for non-valid attempts and valid attempts with unusual entries. The slug generator in particular caused some unfortunate bugs when spaces and non-alphanumeric characters were used which had to be handled in the views.py file with several methods to remove any non-alpha characters and spaces as well as adding a distinct number to each newly generated string. This was all thanks to manual testing. 

Image uploads have all been tested.

## Django Testing

All forms and views were tested for validation and unvalid responses.

## Unfixed Bugs

There are no unfixed bugs that I am aware of at this time. My aim was to have everything which is included working smoothly before submission, rather than adding lots of extra features which were not properly tested or unfinished and beyond the requirements of the prokect scope. 

## Responsive Layout and Design
The project design has been adapted to all types of devices using Bootstrap predefined breakpoints and Chrome's DevTools to digitally test the platform across a number of devices. Three specific media queries were added to solve minor layout issues at specific breakpoints.

**Tested devices:**

    - iPhone SE 
    - iPhone XR 
    - iPhone 12 Pro
    - iPhone 14 Pro Max
    - Pixel 7
    - Samsung Galaxy S8+
