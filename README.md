Coaches E-Commerce Site

Business to Customer
Single Payment system (not subscription)
Product is affordable video tutorials designed to encourage sign up to online or in-person coaching sessions. 
Some customers will be satisfied with videos, this acts as passive income for the coach and filters favourable clients who are familiar and already like coach’s style.
Video tutorials are 25 minutes each(could even be 15 mins if that’s preferred). They come in sets. Access to video sets can be purchased individually or bundles. 
Suggest £10 a set or £25 for 3. This is cheap(need to balance self-valuation with accessibility - NEEDS DISCUSSION WITH COACH - openly addressing this low cost might be most confident thing of all- cheap videos because session are where the real work happens
Discount codes need to work so they can be distributed on social media
A newsletter with subscription option needs to open once with a pop-up including offer of discount. Newsletter released with each new set of videos. No regular spam bullshit. 
Online “E-Session” slots. Clients can book these appointments and pre-pay. Coach must keep these appointment and block out unavailability ahead of time. Could offer first session free after sign-up for discovery and assessment. This could be achieved with a calendar booking system.
On-demand E-session slots are a chance to engage in a new client. A method of connecting with a tentative potential client which is the challenge as people lacking confidence struggle to reach out. COACH DICTATE PRICE PLEASE
Contact form for In-person sessions. Need to discuss preferences of the coach
Selling tickets to group session is also a great way to offer an affordable entry for tentative clients. Now it’s likely early on that anyone booking may find themselves in a one-to-one. This can be made clear that it’s a potential on quieter weeks and a bonus for them if they are so lucky to get a private session at a discounted group rate. COACH DICTATE PRICES PLEASE
About Section needs to address the history of the coach and blend every story with how that relates to the type of coaching being offered.
Testimonials (can be fake or real depending on availability) can create a form for these to be recorded electronically after sessions if necessary. Maybe ask professionals coach has worked with previously for one liner quotes. Too awkward then ask family or I will make them up. 
Resources section : this is where the coach can show their knowledge and keenness to impart confidence and wisdom on the client. Can be a list of book, sites, videos. Must not redirect to other coaches unless agreed with other coach previously and not funneling business away. Good to inform, no point shooting self in the foot. 
Tech Specs : 
Need to be able to login with email, username or social accounts links, namely Facebook and Google 
Need to be able to pay with card, Apple Pay or PayPal
Bookings should be able to push an appointment to Google calendar of client or outlook calendar.
A video conferencing tool might be useful. Equally an emailed video link for Google chat or zoom might be better quality and just as good. Offer FaceTime as an alternative option for IPhone users. 
Needs its own domain
Not expecting drastic traffic. Heroku hosting should be fine.
Accessibility :
site will be fully accessible with hidden features for users with disabilities, image tags and text on all features for clients with screen readers. 
Pathing :
users can browse all content and videos without playing them while not logged in. Only logged in accounts can access the videos they have paid for.
Account page of users shows previous purchases and session bookings 
Booked Sessions :
Authorised accounts could pay for sessions in singles or bundles. This contains all the coaches payments to a single platform. Organised their schedule and leaves room for moving or rebooking sessions.
This keeps cash out of the equation which feels more professional and keeps the coaches image clean. Also avoids issues with clients forgetting to pay or not bringing cash on the day.
If the coach needs to rebook there needs to be a process for this. The client account is refunded a session, an email is sent, and they are able to rebook a free slot in the calendar. 
Vibe :
Confidence / Clarity / impact 
Practicing what you preach is important. Messages and processes need to be extra clear and effective.
There is a tendency towards some pushy salesmanship from some coaches site. Particularly Americans that I’ve looked over. This could be a culture thing. Driving with negative fear building statements (“you don’t know what you’re missing”, “can you afford not to take this course”). But I really don’t like this and think there is a gentle pragmatic approach that allows the client to come to you willingly or walk off if they feel it’s not right. 
This positive gentle approach also fosters a more positive community, client retention and recommendations by word of mouth. 
Aesthetically there needs to be a clear brand image. A logo and continuation in the typography. 
Classy, legible, soothing tones. I like off-white skin tones with a single brand colour. 
A three word mantra for a tag line. This defines your brand. They are the words the client says to their friend across the water cooler.
Trustworthy, quality service, approachable by all
Business Services :
It’s good to advertise B2B services but we will keep this to a contact form with a brief About Section describing the business courses. No business will buy online and it distracts/intimidates private clients. 
Gifting : 
Session or session bundles as well as video access can be purchased as a gift. This does not authorise the buyer account but generates a code and email. This is sent to the recipient email. The recipient can create an account and cash in the gift of videos or sessions which will be debited to their account
CONTENT TYPES :
Content always needs to include a practical tip for the client. What can they do to improve. 


Videos:
example of problem behaviour / description of why people do this / practical solutions

Feeling Comfortable in Social Settings
First Impressions with Gravity
Video quality needs to be high, sound quality needs to be immaculate, setting should be calming and focused on coach. No AI blur effects. Waist to head unless legs are needed for content. Looking at the lense. Should feel natural, like a one to one. 
These are tasters for clients to feel a little of what coach’s E-session feel like. They should feel satisfied with the content and keen absorbers should want to feel comfortable with wanting to ask more questions, this is what sessions are for. 
Complex videos should be book ended with an acknowledgment that this is an overview and that watchers who find the content helpful but feel they need more should reach out for a discovery chat, don’t push bookings or further payments. Need to speak and see if coach can help first. 
Rules: 
Clients can cancel up to 24 hours before a session.
Session token is refunded and they can book again. 
Within 24 hours session is consumed.
More than 15 minutes lateness will result in cancellation. No reason, no problem. Valid reason given via email then coach can refund token at own discretion. (Simple tool for this in site will be included. 
If client buys several session and then doesn’t want the remainder after a session it is fine to refund these. No point being stingey if it costed coach no more time. No refund on gifted sessions. 
Session must be used within 12 months or they will be cancelled. This encourages use.
